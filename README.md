# WISFI  🍽️

## Summary 🍔🌍
What is in food is a application designed for users who want to quickly and easily find out what’s in their food. The app allows users to scan or search for food items and meals, then displays detailed information about ingredients, nutritional values, allergens, and the quantity of each component. This enables users to make more informed dietary decisions based on their health goals, allergies, or diets.

## Privacy 🔐

The application does not request any unnecessary permissions, ensuring user privacy and security.
